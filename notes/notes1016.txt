Possible reason on why time change model worked below
In our model we saw that at a certain time point the betas are flat (limited observations 2007 + varying intercept = no slope)
Lets look at varying model slopes pre and post 2007 to confirm this
Don't see anything here in plots
Which makes sense since relationship should be more dependent on demand than time
Lets find if with varying itnercept alone (without varying slope), slope is positive and eventually zeros out

For fixed intercept when we have two points close to each other with drastically different PDL we will get an extreme slope
This occurs in both the positive and negative direction.
Some of these differences in PDL may be worth examining because they are quite extreme

If we start to subset the slopes from the fixed linear model to remove extremes we see a bit of a pattern but not the same pattern.
We see betas which increase as demand avg increases and decrease at high levels of demand avg.
